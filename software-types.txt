Software can be divided into different types such as web applications, mobile applications, and desktop applications. Each type runs on a different platform and is designed for specific user needs. These software types help deliver services through browsers, smartphones, or computers.
Web applications are software programs that run in a web browser instead of being installed on a device. They are accessed through the internet using URLs and work on any device with a browser. A web application usually includes a frontend that users interact with and a backend that processes data on the server. They are easy to update because changes happen directly on the server without requiring users to reinstall anything.
