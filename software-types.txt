Software can be divided into different types such as web applications, mobile applications, and desktop applications. Each type runs on a different platform and is designed for specific user needs. These software types help deliver services through browsers, smartphones, or computers.
Web applications are software programs that run in a web browser instead of being installed on a device. They are accessed through the internet using URLs and work on any device with a browser. A web application usually includes a frontend that users interact with and a backend that processes data on the server. They are easy to update because changes happen directly on the server without requiring users to reinstall anything.
Mobile applications are software programs designed to run on smartphones and tablets. They are usually downloaded from app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store. Mobile apps can use device features such as the camera, GPS, and sensors to provide a richer experience. They can work online or offline depending on the functionality they offer.
