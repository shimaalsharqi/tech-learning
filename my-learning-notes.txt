Today I learned how Git helps track changes in a project using simple commands. I learned that git status shows the current state of files, and git add moves changes to the staging area. The git commit command saves a version of the project, and git push uploads the commits to GitHub. I also learned how to use git pull to bring updates from the remote repository and how to resolve merge conflicts when files have different changes locally and remotely.
