This makes it ideal for applications that require fast development, scalability, and handling unstructured or changing data. MongoDB is commonly used in modern web and mobile applications where data formats can vary.

PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an advanced relational database known for its strong performance, security, and support for complex queries. It follows SQL standards closely and offers many powerful features like JSON support and custom data types. PostgreSQL is often used in enterprise-level applications that require high reliability and accuracy.
